    Verbs are words that show an action (sing), occurrence (develop), or state of being (exist). Almost every sentence requires a verb. The basic form of a verb is known as its<b><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/infinitive">infinitive</a></b>. The forms call, love, break, and go are all infinitives.
